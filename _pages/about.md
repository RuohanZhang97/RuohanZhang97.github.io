I am an Assistant Professor at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), University of Warwick, and a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge. I am also a member of the Data Science for Mental Health (DS4MH) Group at the Alan Turing Institute. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick, working with Prof. Jianfeng Feng and Prof. Edmund Rolls.

My research interests lie in applying Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to advance healthcare, with a particular focus on developing computational methods to advance our understanding of brain health, human cognition, and broader healthcare applications. My research leverages large-scale, multi-modal datasets, such as the UK Biobank and the Human Connectome Project (HCP), etc., to gain new insights into brain health and cognitive processes.
