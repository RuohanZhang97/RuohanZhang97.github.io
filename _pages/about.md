I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/" target="_blank">Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG)</a>, <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Warwick</a>, and a Visiting Scholar at the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Department of Psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/data-science-mental-health" target="_blank">Data Science for Mental Health (DS4MH) Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Alan Turing Institute</a>. I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> at the University of Warwick, working with <a href="https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~feng/" target="_blank">Prof. Jianfeng Feng</a> and <a href="https://www.oxcns.org/profile.html" target="_blank">Prof. Edmund T. Rolls</a>.

My research interests lie in applying Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to advance healthcare, with a particular focus on developing computational methods to advance our understanding of brain health, human cognition, and broader healthcare applications. My research leverages large-scale, multi-modal datasets, such as the UK Biobank, the Human Connectome Project (HCP), etc., to gain new insights into brain health and cognitive processes.
