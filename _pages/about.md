I am an Assistant Professor at the [Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/), [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), and a Visiting Scholar at the [Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge](https://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/). I am also a member of the [Data Science for Mental Health (DS4MH) Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/data-science-mental-health) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I obtained my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/) at the University of Warwick, working with [Prof. Jianfeng Feng](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~feng/) and [Prof. Edmund T. Rolls](https://www.oxcns.org/profile.html).

My research interests lie in applying Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to advance healthcare, with a particular focus on developing computational methods to advance our understanding of brain health, human cognition, and broader healthcare applications. My research leverages large-scale, multi-modal datasets, such as the UK Biobank, the Human Connectome Project (HCP), etc., to gain new insights into brain health and cognitive processes.
